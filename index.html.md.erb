Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for apps. Buildpacks typically examine your apps to determine what dependencies to download and how to configure the apps to communicate with bound services.

When you push an app, Cloud Foundry automatically detects an appropriate buildpack for it. This buildpack is used to compile or prepare your app for launch.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Cloud Foundry deployments often have limited access to dependencies. This limitation occurs when the deployment is behind a firewall, or when administrators want to use local mirrors and proxies. In these circumstances, Cloud Foundry provides a <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpack-packager"> Buildpack Packager</a> app.</p>

### <a id='buildpack-ci'></a> Using Continuous Integration for Buildpacks

For information about updating and releasing a new version of a Cloud Foundry buildpack through the Cloud Foundry Buildpacks Team Concourse pipeline, see <a href="./buildpack-ci-index.html">Using CI for Buildpacks</a>. You can use this as a model when working with Concourse to build and release new versions of your own buildpacks.
