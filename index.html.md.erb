Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for apps. Buildpacks typically examine your apps to determine what dependencies to download and how to configure the apps to communicate with bound services.

When you push an app, <%= vars.product_runtime %> (<%= vars.product_short %>) automatically detects an appropriate buildpack for it. This buildpack is used to compile or prepare your app for launch.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.product_short %> deployments often have limited access to dependencies. This limitation occurs when the deployment is behind a firewall, or when administrators want to use local mirrors and proxies. In these circumstances, <%= vars.product_short %> provides a Buildpack Packager app. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpack-packager">Buildpack Packager</a> repository on GitHub.</p>
